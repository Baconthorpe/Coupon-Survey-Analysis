# Coupon Survey Analysis

## Project Organization
My work for this project can be found in this [notebook](./prompt.ipynb). It includes responses to the exercise's questions, my own analysis and that analysis' accompanying visualizations.

## Problem
When considering restaurant coupons, which drivers are most likely to accept? And does this acceptance rate vary from inexpensive restaurant coupons to expensive restaurant coupons? I examine three filters that I surmise will show the highest acceptance rates.

## Conclusion
Ultimately, while restaurant-visiting habits turn out to affect chances of coupon acceptance for restaurant coupons, the difference it represents is modest and samples with the highest acceptance rates also prove fairly small. The data illustrates the risk of overemphasizing the significance of appealing subsets.
